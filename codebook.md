# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
### Data transformation
These were the transformations applied to obtain the first tidy data set called total _data
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

And the second tidy data set called total _data_2 was obtain
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### Identififiers
- activities: each of the six activities carry out for each subject.
- subject are identified with numbers of 1 to 30

### Measurements
These variables are the ones left after applying the considerations in the assignment
